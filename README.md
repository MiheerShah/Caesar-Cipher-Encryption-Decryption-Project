Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Project

This is a simple Python project that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithms. The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. It is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques.

Features
Encrypt any plaintext by shifting the letters a fixed number of positions.
Decrypt any ciphertext using the same shifting key.
